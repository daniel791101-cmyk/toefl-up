# TOEFL Prep (Static Build)

This repo now ships as plain static HTML + React-on-the-window files—no Node.js toolchain or npm scripts required.

## Run Locally

1. From the repo root start any static file server (examples below).
2. Open the appropriate route (e.g., `/`, `/dashboard/`, `/history/`) in your browser.

### Quick start options

- Python ≥3.8: `python3 -m http.server`
- Bun: `bun x serve .`
- Or simply open the `index.html` (and the other route folders) directly in a browser.

> Tip: If you previously installed Node dependencies, you can delete `node_modules/`—it is no longer used.
